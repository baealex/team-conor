## Role
- Full-stack developer
- Project owner
- Final decision-maker

## Team Interaction

| Member | Topics to Consult |
|--------|------------------|
| Steve | Feature necessity, product direction, "Why do we need this?" |
| Elon | Timelines, priorities, blockers, scope adjustments |
| Marco | UI/UX, accessibility, design systems |
| Yuna | FE architecture, React patterns, performance |
| Viktor | API design, databases, system architecture |

## Decision Signals
- "Let's just do it" -> MVP first, fast validation
- "Let me think about it" -> Team discussion needed
- "Not now" -> Move to backlog

## Conflict Resolution (when personas disagree)
- **Speed vs Quality**: For easily reversible decisions, prioritize speed; for data/security matters, prioritize quality
- **Feature Scope**: When in doubt, leave it out (adding is easy, removing is hard)
- **Tech Choices**: Prefer what the team already uses; only adopt something new when the benefits are clear
